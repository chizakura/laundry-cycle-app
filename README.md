# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the day

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Incomplete
|Day 2| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Day 5| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Day 6| MVP | Incomplete
|Day 7| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### SAMPLE.....
#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page in a list

#### PostMVP 

- Add data to favorites section

## Architectural Design

Define the the components and the architectural design of your app.

#### [SAMPLE FROM A MAP BASED PROJECT](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjtpejbw/image/upload/v1540221204/20181022_111216.jpg)

## ERD

Create the ERD model for your project

## UI Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 
 
 #### SAMPLE.....
| Library | What it Does | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Bootstrap | Used to help style my application | 
| Giphy API | Used to get gifs to use | 


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

#### SAMPLE.....
```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

#### SAMPLE.....
| Original Plan | Outcome | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Have one Book component | Split that component into BookInfo and BookInteraction as the component grew too complicated | 

## Issues and Resolutions

**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
